# ðŸŽª The Circus - Clown Finance Application Hub

We created the circus with just one app for starters, which is the no-loose-raffle, a mad kind of pool where every user stakes an amount of tickets, which will be staked for a pre-defined amount of time and afterwards, one of the participants will be randomly selected using VRF (A Verifiable Random Function).

That lucky one will get all the **fees* from the pool, and all the ~~losers~~ other participants will be able to claim back his initial stake minus a small fee.

## And why it's a hub?

This is built as an open framework where we will be adding new games but it has an open SDK where games can be added after a verification process, to build this circus up and create a complete kermesse in the process.

## Architecture
