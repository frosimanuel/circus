# ‚úÖ Ready to Deploy - All Changes Complete

## Summary of Changes

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Ticket Pricing (0.01 SOL per ticket)
- Users can only buy whole tickets
- Client + contract validation
- Clear error messages

### 2. ‚úÖ Ticket Number Assignment
- Sequential numbering: User sees "Tickets #42-#46"
- Tracked in `RoundState.total_tickets_sold`
- Stored in `UserAccount.ticket_start` and `ticket_end`

### 3. ‚úÖ Fast Epoch Duration (2 minutes for demo)
- Testing: 2-minute epochs
- Production: Change constant to 1 week (604800 seconds)

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Contract built successfully**
‚úÖ **Frontend updated**
‚úÖ **IDL copied**
‚úÖ **All features tested locally**
‚è≥ **NOT deployed yet** - waiting for your approval

## Files Modified

### Contract (`programs/rafa/src/lib.rs`):
- Added ticket pricing constants
- Added epoch duration constant
- Modified `deposit()` function
- Updated `RoundState` struct (+8 bytes)
- Updated `UserAccount` struct (+16 bytes)
- Added 2 new error codes

### Frontend:
- `src/utils/tickets.ts` - NEW utility functions
- `src/hooks/useRaffleTransactions.ts` - Updated with validation
- `src/idl/rafa.json` - Updated IDL

### Scripts:
- All deployment scripts still work
- `initialize.js` will work with new structure
- `manage.js` will work with new structure

## Deployment Options

### Option A: Fresh Deploy (Recommended)
**Best for testing, cleanest approach**

```bash
# 1. Deploy as new program (generates new ID)
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# 2. Update declare_id! in lib.rs with new ID

# 3. Rebuild
anchor build

# 4. Deploy again
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# 5. Initialize fresh protocol
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com \
ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json \
node scripts/initialize.js devnet

# 6. Update frontend config with new program ID
```

### Option B: Upgrade Existing (Keep Same ID)
**Riskier, but keeps same program ID**

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Account structures changed, existing accounts will break!

```bash
# 1. Upgrade program
anchor upgrade target/deploy/rafa.so \
  --program-id 3u9hRUKw79MKPobpfiapPfJuUqWARW4YfEBHbxY14bs1 \
  --provider.cluster devnet

# 2. Need to close/migrate old accounts
# 3. Reinitialize protocol (will fail if already init)
```

### Recommendation:
**Use Option A (Fresh Deploy)** because:
- Clean slate
- No migration headaches
- Devnet has minimal users anyway
- Safer testing

## Testing Plan After Deployment

### 1. Initialize Protocol (1 minute)
```bash
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com \
ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json \
node scripts/initialize.js devnet
```

### 2. User Deposits (Epoch 1 - 2 minutes)
```
- Open frontend
- Connect wallet (devnet mode)
- Buy tickets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 SOL
- See ticket numbers: #1, #2-#4, #5-#9
```

### 3. Advance Epoch 2 (after 2 min)
```bash
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com \
ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json \
node scripts/manage.js devnet advance-epoch
```

### 4. Advance Epoch 3 (after 4 min total)
```bash
node scripts/manage.js devnet advance-epoch
```

### 5. Select Winner (after 6 min total)
```bash
node scripts/manage.js devnet select-winner
```

### 6. Check Results
- Frontend shows winner
- Winner's ticket number displayed
- Users see their ticket numbers

## Frontend Display Example

**Before deposit:**
```
No tickets
Balance: 0 SOL
```

**After buying 5 tickets (0.05 SOL):**
```
Your Tickets: #1-#5 (5 tickets)
Balance: 0.05 SOL staked
Round: #1, Epoch: 1/3
```

**After winner selected:**
```
Winning Ticket: #3
Winner: ABC...XYZ

Your tickets: #1-#5
Result: YOU WON! üéâ
(or)
Result: Lost this round
```

## Configuration for Production

Before mainnet, change in `lib.rs`:

```rust
// FROM (testing):
pub const EPOCH_DURATION_SECONDS: i64 = 120; // 2 minutes

// TO (production):
pub const EPOCH_DURATION_SECONDS: i64 = 604800; // 1 week
```

## What Happens When You Deploy

1. Program code updates on devnet
2. Old accounts become incompatible
3. Need fresh initialization
4. Users start from zero
5. New deposits get ticket numbers
6. Quick 2-minute epochs for demo

## Ready?

Everything is prepared and ready to go. Just say the word and I'll:

1. Deploy the program (fresh or upgrade - you choose)
2. Initialize the protocol
3. Verify everything works
4. Guide you through first test cycle

**What would you like to do?**
- Deploy fresh (new program ID)?
- Deploy upgrade (same ID, riskier)?
- Make more changes first?
- Test locally more?

All code is ready and waiting! üöÄ
